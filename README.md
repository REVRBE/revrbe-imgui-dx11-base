# imgui DX11 base with XenForo authentication

I really have no interest in updating my DX9 base, so I figured it would probably be better to release one for DX11 - hopefully with future updates to improve and/or add new stuff.

## Features

✅ XenForo authentication (returning highest rank with the default login.php)  
✅ DragonByte support (returning all licenses; license id, product id and expiry date with the DragonByte login.php file)  
✅ Color schemes readded to DX11 base; + remembers last color  
✅ TLS/SSL encryption  
✅ Medium protection against SQL injections  
✅ DX11  
❌ Using returned data to display it  

I'll update the README later
